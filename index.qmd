## Introduction

This is an introductory guide to use ArcGIS StoryMaps to create and share interactive and multimedia stories.

A video tutorial is also available. Click [here](https://felipevaldez.com/StoryMaps_intro2026/1) if you prefer to use the video guides.

You will learn to login to ArcGIS StoryMaps using your Temple University account, the basics of the StoryMaps workspace, to create your first StoryMap with a cover, title and subtitles, to add multimedia and interactive elements to your story and, to publish and share the story.

## What is ArcGIS StoryMaps?

![](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/static/images/social-sharing-card.jpeg)

[ArcGIS StoryMaps](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-storymaps/overview) is a web-based storytelling platform created by Esri that combines interactive maps with narrative text, images, videos, and other multimedia content. It's designed to help people create compelling, map-based stories that communicate information in an engaging way.

StoryMaps lets you build narratives that readers scroll through, with maps that can zoom, pan, and reveal different layers of information as the story unfolds.

It's particularly useful when location is central to understanding your story - whether you're documenting historical events across different places, showing environmental changes over time, or explaining how geographic factors influence a situation. The tool is accessible to non-technical users while still offering customization options for those who want more control over the design.

## Getting Started

This section will show you how to get started using ArcGIS StoryMaps through your Temple University Account and the main workspace.

## Adding a Sidecar (Immersive Experience)

### What is a Sidecar?

A Sidecar creates an immersive, scrolling experience that combines maps or media with narrative content. As users scroll through your story, the map updates to show different locations while text and images appear alongside.

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}

![](images/sidecar.gif)
:::

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}

![](images/sidecar.png)
:::


::: {.callout-note title="Sidecar Examples"}

See some sidecar examples in [this collection](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/collections/f630a462b29847fa948336a2ada4b02f) from ESRI.
:::

![](images/sidecar02.png)
:::

![](images/sidecar9.png)

#### Add content to the new slide

1. Add a map (search for the new location)
2. Add a title (use Heading 2 or any other type you want)
3. Add an image or video
4. Add descriptive text

::: {.callout-tip title="Adding Content"}

The order you add elements doesn't matter. You can add the title first, then the image, then the map - whichever order works best for you. You can add any content to your story.
:::


#### Manually add a map point (if search doesn't work)

![](images/sidecar12.png)

4. Click ``Save``

::: {.callout-tip title="Choosing a Layout"}

Use **Floating** when the map is the most important visual element

Use **Docked** for a balanced mix of content and map

Use **Slideshow** for a more traditional presentation style

Consider your audience's devices when choosing a layout
:::


## Adding a Map Tour (Immersive Experience)

### What is a Map Tour?

A Map Tour is similar to a Sidecar but designed specifically for showcasing multiple locations on a map. The key difference is that locations are numbered sequentially, and the interface is optimized for point-to-point navigation.

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}

![](images/maptour.gif)
:::

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}

![](images/maptour.png)
:::



::: {.callout-note title="MapTour Examples"}

See some maptour examples in [this collection](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/collections/dd4c2e6d5c2a40dd98e881f6ba616605) from ESRI.
:::

### Create a Map Tour

   - **Explorer Tours - List** - Vertical list of images with map

3. Click **Save**

![](images/maptour2.png){width=400px fig-align="center"}

::: {.callout-note title="Map Tour vs. Sidecar"}

- **Map Tour** uses numbered location markers (1, 2, 3...) instead of custom pins
- Content structure is pre-defined (image, title, description)
- Better for sequential point-to-point tours
:::

![](images/maptour6.png)

::: {.callout-tip title="Managing Slides"}

If you add a slide while viewing an existing one, the new slide will be inserted after the current slide. You can reorder slides using the options menu (three dots).
:::


### Change the Layout

1. Click **Options** in the Map Tour settings
2. Select **Change layout**

![](images/maptour7.png)

- **Map Focused** - When geography and spatial context are most important
- **Media Focused** - When you have compelling images/videos that deserve prominence
- **Explorer Grid/List** - When you want users to explore freely without a set path, or when you have many locations to display

The navigation feature adds a menu to help users jump between sections:

- In the Design panel, toggle **Navigation** on
- A navigation bar appears showing:
   - Main section headings (Heading 1 and Heading 2)
   - Credits section
   - Any custom section titles you've added

**How navigation works:**

- Navigation links appear at the top of your story
- Clicking a link jumps to that section
- The current section is underlined or highlighted
- Great for longer stories with multiple sections

**When to Use Navigation**
Enable navigation if your story:
- Has multiple distinct sections
- Is longer than 3-4 scrolls
- Benefits from allowing users to jump to specific topics
- Contains reference material users might want to revisit

### Add sections to navigation

Any text formatted as **Heading 1** or **Heading 2** automatically appears in the navigation menu:

1. Add a text block where you want a new section
2. Type your section title (e.g., "The Last Section")
3. Select the text
4. Choose **Heading 1** or **Heading 2** from the formatting options
5. The section appears in the navigation menu automatically

**Always Use the Latest Version**
Make sure you're sharing the published version with all your latest changes. If you see "Unpublished changes" at the top, click Publish before sharing.

### Design Best Practices

- **Cover layout** - Choose based on your image and title length
  - Long titles work better with side-by-side or top layouts
  - Striking images work well with full-screen layouts

- **Text positioning** - Ensure text is readable against your cover image
  - Avoid placing text over busy parts of the image
  - Consider adding a semi-transparent overlay if text is hard to read

- **Navigation** - Enable for stories with:
  - 5+ sections
  - Complex content users might want to reference
  - Educational or instructional content

- **Themes** - Stick with one theme for consistency
  - Test different themes to see which fits your content
  - Consider your audience (formal vs. casual)

- **Mobile preview** - Always check mobile appearance
  - Most users may view on phones or tablets
  - Adjust layouts if mobile version doesn't look good

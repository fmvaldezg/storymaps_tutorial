    "text": "2 What is ArcGIS StoryMaps?\n\nArcGIS StoryMaps is a web-based storytelling platform created by Esri that combines interactive maps with narrative text, images, videos, and other multimedia content. It’s designed to help people create compelling, map-based stories that communicate information in an engaging way.\nStoryMaps lets you build narratives that readers scroll through, with maps that can zoom, pan, and reveal different layers of information as the story unfolds.\nIt’s particularly useful when location is central to understanding your story - whether you’re documenting historical events across different places, showing environmental changes over time, or explaining how geographic factors influence a situation. The tool is accessible to non-technical users while still offering customization options for those who want more control over the design."
